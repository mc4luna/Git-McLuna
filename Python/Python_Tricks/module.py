# MODULES
# A module is a collection of Python declarations intended broadly to be used as a tool.
# Modules are also often referred to as “libraries” or “packages” — 
# (a package is really a directory that holds a collection of modules.)

#Ex: from module_name import object_name
# Or import object_name

import random

random_list = []


#print()
